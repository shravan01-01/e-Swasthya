🚀 Project Abstract

Healthcare delivery in India faces three major issues:

Fragmented and paper-based health records.

Limited healthcare access in rural and remote regions.

It connects patients, doctors, and public health systems through a Universal Digital Health ID, ensuring continuous care and data-driven insights for proactive health management.

⚙ Proposed Solution
🔑 Key Modules

Unified DHR — Centralized 24/7 access to all health records.

Secure Access — OTP & Aadhar-based authentication.
