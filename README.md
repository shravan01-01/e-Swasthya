->Project abstract:
 e-Swasthya:
The challenge in modern healthcare lies in fragmented medical records and the lack of real-time epidemiological data for proactive public health management. e-Swasthya addresses this by proposing a unified, secure, and fully digital health ecosystem. The core solution is a Digital Health Record (DHR), which provides Aadhar/OTP-verified, centralized 24/7 access for both patients and licensed doctors, supporting essential functions like appointment management and digital prescription sharing. Crucially, the platform features an Interactive Leaflet Map  that visualizes live and simulated disease outbreaks, transforming disparate clinical data into actionable geographical insights for government and health officials. Built on React and Tailwind CSS, e-Swasthya demonstrates a scalable, mobile-responsive system ready to enhance both individual patient care and large-scale disease surveillance.
